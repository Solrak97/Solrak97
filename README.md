### About me:
I am a computer scientist passionate about research, machine learning and general AI.

* My usual work is on data modeling, creation of ML models and data visualization.
  
* My favorite kind of ML problems involve reinforced and deep reinforced learning, probably because I love watching animations on the improvement of a model!
 
* I've got into computer graphics and procedural content generaion lately as a hobby, I'm sure it's a coping mechanism for my lack of art skills.
